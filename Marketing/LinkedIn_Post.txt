# LinkedIn / "Bull Post" Drafts for KeepAlive

Here are 3 styles of posts you can drop to make some noise.

## Option 1: The "Indie Hacker" (Raw & Relatable)
**Hook:** The "Silent Death" of free-tier projects is real. 💀

**Body:**
I woke up yesterday to check a demo I built 3 weeks ago. It was down.
Not because of a bug. Not because of traffic.
But because I hadn't touched the database in 7 days, so the provider "paused" it to save resources.

The crazy part? I had visitors on the site. But since they were just reading cached static pages, the DB thought it was being ignored.

**Users ≠ Database Activity.**

I didn’t want to upgrade to Pro ($25/mo) just for a side project.
I didn't want to use a sketchy "uptime bot" that pings my site every minute.

So I built **KeepAlive**.

It’s a "Serverless Heartbeat" for your side projects.
✅ Uses GitHub Actions (runs inside YOUR repo)
✅ 0% Data Privacy Risk (I never see your DB credentials)
✅ Standard Cron Schedule (Tue/Thu pings)
✅ Keeps Supabase/Neon/Render active legally.

It’s the simplest way to stop your portfolio from embarrassing you during a job interview.

**CTA:**
Building this in public. Who wants the repo link when it's ready? 👇

## Option 2: The "Software Engineer" (Technical & Smart)
**Hook:** Why I built a decentralized health-check system for my side projects. 🛠️

**Body:**
We all love the modern "Free Tier" (Supabase, Render, Neon). But they all share one aggressive policy: **Inactivity Pausing.**

If your DB doesn't receive a query for ~7 days, it sleeps. This kills demos, legacy projects, and portfolio pieces.

Existing solution: "Uptime Monitors."
Problem: They only ping your frontend. If your frontend is Next.js (static), your DB still sleeps.

My solution: **KeepAlive** ⚡️

It’s a decentralized architecture:
1. **The Agent**: A GitHub Action lives in *your* repo. It creates a legitimate, low-cost connection to your DB (e.g., `SELECT 1`).
2. **The Dashboard**: A stateless Next.js app that simply catches the "I'm Alive" signal.

**Why is this better?**
Security.
I don't hold your database credentials. You don't hand me your connection string. You own the infrastructure; I just provide the visibility.

Dogfooding it right now to keep itself alive. 🚀

**CTA:**
Dropping the GitHub link soon. Thoughts on this architecture?

## Option 3: The "Bull Post" (Hype & Value) 🐂
**Hook:** NEVER let your side projects die again. 🛑

**Body:**
Nothing is worse than sending a link to a client/investor and having it spin for 30 seconds because the database is "waking up" (or totally dead).

It looks amateur. It kills conversion.

I got tired of logging into 10 different Supabase dashboards just to "poke" the database active.

So I automated it.

**Enter: KeepAlive.**

It’s a set-and-forget reliance tool.
1. Add 1 file to your repo.
2. It pings your DB twice a week.
3. Your project stays online forever.

Free tiers are great. Making them reliable is better.

I'm making this open source. Stop paying $25/mo just to keep a mostly-idle project awake.

**CTA:**
Drop a "👋" if you want early access.
