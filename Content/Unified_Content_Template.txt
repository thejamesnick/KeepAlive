# 0. THE CONTENT BANK (How to handle big days)

**The Premise:** You might fix 10 bugs in one day. That is 10 potential pieces of content.
**The Trap:** Posting all 10 at once (noise).
**The Win:** "Banking" them to diversify your feed for weeks.

**Workflow:**
1.  **Action:** You fix 5 bugs and build 1 feature today.
2.  **Draft:** You write 3 BIPs, 1 CodeBite, and 1 DevLog immediately.
3.  **Bank:** Save them.
4.  **Drip:** Post them 1-by-1 over the next week.

**Rule:** Build fast, release slow.

# 1. PRODUCT RESIDENCE (The Monthly Container)

**Purpose:** A structured "residency" where you focus on **one product per month**. 
**Goal:** Signal that you are a "Product Operator" who understands systems, users, and shipping.

## Monthly Frame (Internal)
*   **Product:** [Name/Description]
*   **Focus:** [Core problem solving]
*   **Constraint:** [Time, users, tech, scope]

## Weekly Content Schedule

### Week 1: Context & Problem (The Intent)
*   **Focus:** What users struggle with vs. what you are solving.
*   **Signal:** You think in problems, not just code.
*   **Template Hook:** "Most products fail here: [specific problem]... This month I'm fixing [X]."

### Week 2: Decisions & Trade-offs (The Judgment)
*   **Focus:** Tech vs. UX. Option A vs. Option B.
*   **Signal:** Taste and Senior decision-making.
*   **Template Hook:** "I had to choose between [Option A] and [Option B]. I picked [Choice] because..."

### Week 3: Friction & Reality (The Humility)
*   **Focus:** Implementation realities. What went wrong? What was harder than expected?
*   **Signal:** Real experience. Avoiding "perfect builder" fake vibes.
*   **Template Hook:** "Something I underestimated: [unexpected issue]. On paper it made sense. In reality..."

### Week 4: Reflection & Insight (The Transferable Lesson)
*   **Focus:** One strong lesson that applies anywhere.
*   **Signal:** Pattern recognition.
*   **Template Hook:** "Wrapping up [Product], one thing is clear: [Lesson]."

# 2. DEVLOG (The Deep Lesson)

**Purpose:** Demonstrate engineering maturity by analyzing **one real problem**.
**Frequency:** When you solve something specific and non-trivial.
**Golden Rule:** Answer "What did I learn that saves another dev time/money?"

## The Canonical DevLog Template

### 1. Title
*   Clear/Technical (e.g., "Why Our Wallet Reconnected Every Session")

### Constraints (Canonical)
*   **Target Length:** Up to 1000 words. (Deep dive allowed)
*   **Focus:** One learning, not a narration of your day.

### Full Practical Example (Reference)
**Title: Why Our Wallet Reconnected Every Session**

**Context:** I’m building an on‑chain gifting feature. Users had to reconnect their wallet every time they opened the app.
**Problem:** My initial assumption was a front‑end state bug (UI/cache). That was wrong.
**Investigation:** I inspected local storage; data was there. The key signal: reconnection only happened on full app restarts, not refreshes.
**Insight:** The issue was **session invalidation timing**. The app couldn't distinguish between an "expired" session and an "un-rehydrated" one.
**Fix:** I persisted session metadata (not just address) and validated it explicitly on startup.
**Takeaway:** If you’re building wallet products, treat session logic as UX infrastructure. Fix auth before design.

### 2. Context
*   What are you building? Why does this part matter?

### 3. The Problem
*   What broke?
*   What was your (wrong) initial assumption? -> *Critical Step*

### 4. Investigation
*   How did you reason? 
*   What ruled out false leads?
*   What was the key signal?

### 5. The Insight
*   The root cause (abstracted).
*   "I learned that [X] is usually a [Y] problem, not a connectivity problem."

### 6. The Fix
*   Briefly: What changed and why it worked.

### 7. Takeaway
*   Reusable rule for others. 
*   "If building X, treat Y as infrastructure."

## Platform Adaptations (Deriving Content)

### LinkedIn (Text Post)
*   **Target Length:** Up to 1000 words. (Long-form supported)
*   **Structure:**
    1.  Short Context
    2.  Clear Problem
    3.  Insight
    4.  One Strong Takeaway
*   **Tone:** Professional, clear, no fluff.

### TikTok / Reels (Video)
*   **Target Length:** 60–90 seconds. (1–1.5 mins)
*   **Structure:**
    1.  **Hook:** Context + Problem ("I was building X and Y broke.")
    2.  **Core:** Insight ("I thought it was Z, but it was actually A.")
    3.  **Close:** Takeaway ("So remember to check A.")

# 3. BIP (Build In Public - The Narrative Pulse)

**Purpose:** The **story layer**. Captures momentum, feelings, and "decisions-in-motion."
**Tone:** Lightweight, honest, slightly playful.
**Frequency:** 3-5 times/week.

## The Pillars (Pick ONE per post)
*   **Progress:** Something moved forward.
*   **Decision:** You chose X over Y.
*   **Tension:** Something is unclear or broken.
*   **Win:** A small victory.

## BIP Template v2.0

**1. Anchor (Set Scene):**
*   "Building [Product]..."

**2. Pulse (Action):**
*   "Today [Action happened]..."

**3. Signal (Friction/Insight):**
*   "Was harder than expected because..." OR "Finally clicked."

**4. Direction (Next Step):**
*   "Next: [Specific Move]."

*Example:*
> Building the gifting flow.
> Decided to persist session metadata.
> More logic upfront, less UX pain later.
> Feels right. Next: edge cases.

# 4. CODEBITE (The Technical Snack)

**Purpose:** Share small, digestible coding challenges/tips.
**Tone:** Teaching, helpful, bite-sized.
**Frequency:** ~1 per week.

## CodeBite Template

### 1. Challenge (1-2 lines)
*   "CodeBite #01: [Simple Problem, e.g., Reverse a string in TS]"

### 2. Hint (1-3 lines)
*   "Hint: [Approach without full solution]"

### 3. Code Snippet (Image or Text)
*   5-10 lines max showing the elegant solution.

### 4. Mini Lesson
*   "Why this works / Why it's useful."

### 5. Tease (Optional)
*   "Try more at CodeShop."
