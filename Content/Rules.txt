    2.  **The Spark:** The moment it broke or the moment of idea.
    3.  **The Friction (Crucial):** Explain *why* it was hard. Explain the "False Leads" (e.g., "I thought it was X, but it was Y"). Explain *why* existing tools failed.

## 4. SECTION 3: THE CODEBITE (The Technical Snack)

*   **Hint:** The mental model shift.
*   **Snippet:** 5-15 lines of code. Heavily commented.
